Our Roadmap for the Surfer Project: - to be discussed
•	Day 1: Brainstorming, data collection – gathering all necessary data, such as location, gender, activity, injuries, checking for co-relations
•	Day 2: Data cleaning and wrangling – handling null values, removing duplicates, manipulating strings, and formatting the data. Data cleaning process, focusing on non-date fields. 
•	Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis – understanding the data, identifying patterns, and looking for any correlations. Validate or disprove the hypothesis? 
•	Day 4: EDA, Clean,Analyze and develop final report!
•	Day 4: Present!!!

# CLEANING DUTIES:
# - Column 'Date' : Check with Garima
# - Column 'Year' : Check with Garima
# - Column 'Type'
# - Column 'Country'
# - Column 'State'
# - Column 'Activity'
# - Column 'Injury' -- Injury: fatal 0, non-fatal 1, not specified -1? String would also work if uniformal (ofc) - Nicole (we can probably iterate here over the column, see minute 31:00 in YT video)
# - Column 'Time' : Check with Marco
# - Column 'Species' : Done
# A thought, can we also punt statistics that we learned during W2day3, grouping etc.? - Yey we should try to find correlation etc
#Notes - Nicole
# df.fillna('not specified) - we could fill this across the whole dataframe
# we need a no injury too
